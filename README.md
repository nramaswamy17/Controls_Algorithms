# Summary

This aims to cover what I think the key history of control algorithms are from PID to modern advanced architectures to provide I know *something* about controls :)

# Algorithms
## Fundamental Controls
- PID 
- KF
- LQR

## Intermediate Controls
- MPC
    - Linear MPC
    - Non-linear MPC
- iLQR
- CBF

## Modern 
- Learning MPC

## SOTA
- To be determined...
